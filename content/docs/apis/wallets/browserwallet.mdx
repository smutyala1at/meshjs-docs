`BrowserWallet` provides APIs for interacting with browser-based wallets in accordance with CIP-30. This standard defines the communication protocol between applications and user wallets, ensuring compatibility and security.

In addition to the CIP-30 APIs, `BrowserWallet` includes utility functions that simplify common tasks such as retrieving wallet balances, signing transactions, and managing UTXOs.

This section allows you to explore and test the available APIs for browser wallets, enabling seamless integration into your applications.


## Get Available Wallets

Returns a list of wallets available on user's device. Each wallet is an object with the following properties:

- A name is provided to display wallet's name on the user interface.
- A version is provided to display wallet's version on the user interface.
- An icon is provided to display wallet's icon on the user interface.

<Card>
  #### Get Available Wallets [!toc]

  Get a list of wallets on user's device

  ```tsx
  import { BrowserWallet } from 'meshsdk/core';

  await BrowserWallet.getAvailableWallets()
  ```
</Card>

Example response:
```tsx
[
  {
    "name": "eternl",
    "icon": "data:image/png;base64,ICONBASE64HERE",
    "version": "0.1.0"
  }
]
```


## Connect Wallet

This is the entrypoint to start communication with the user's wallet. The wallet should request the user's permission to connect the web page to the user's wallet, and if permission has been granted, the wallet will be returned and exposing the full API for the app to use.

Query `BrowserWallet.getAvailableWallets()` to get a list of available wallets, then provide the wallet `name` for which wallet the user would like to connect with.

You can also provide an `extensions` object to enable specific CIPs. For Example response, to enable CIP95, you would pass:

```tsx
await BrowserWallet.enable('eternl', [95]);
```

<Card>
  #### Connect Wallet [!toc]

  Connect to a CIP30 compatible wallet

  ```tsx
  import { BrowserWallet } from '@meshsdk/core';

  const wallet = await BrowserWallet.enable('eternl');
  ```
</Card>


## Get Balance

This API retrieves a list of all assets in the connected wallet. Each asset is represented as an object containing the following properties:

- Unit: A unique identifier for the asset, which can be used to display its name in the user interface.
- Quantity: The amount of the asset held in the wallet.

This information is useful for applications that need to display wallet balances or perform operations involving specific assets.


<Card>
  #### Get Balance [!toc]

  Get all assets in the connected wallet

  ```tsx
  await wallet.getBalance();
  ```
</Card>

Example response:
```tsx
[
  {
    "unit": "lovelace",
    "quantity": "796105407"
  },
  {
    "unit": "0f5560dbc05282e05507aedb02d823d9d9f0e583cce579b81f9d1cd8",
    "quantity": "1"
  },
  {
    "unit": "9c8e9da7f81e3ca90485f32ebefc98137c8ac260a072a00c4aaf142d4d657368546f6b656e",
    "quantity": "2"
  },
]
```


## Get Change Address

This API returns an address owned by the wallet that should be used as a change address. A change address is where leftover assets from a transaction are returned during its creation. This ensures that any unspent assets are sent back to the connected wallet.

Applications can use this API to manage transaction outputs effectively, ensuring proper handling of change during transactions.

<Card>
  #### Get Change Address [!toc]

  Get address that should be used for transaction's change

  ```tsx
  await wallet.getChangeAddress();
  ```
</Card>


## Get Collateral

This API retrieves a list of UTXOs (unspent transaction outputs) controlled by the wallet that can be used as collateral inputs for transactions involving Plutus scripts. The returned UTXOs must meet or exceed the specified ADA value target.

If the target cannot be met, an error message will be returned explaining the issue. Wallets may return UTXOs with a greater total ADA value than requested but must never return UTXOs with a smaller total value.

This functionality is essential for applications that need to create transactions requiring collateral inputs.

<Card>
  #### Get Collateral [!toc]

  Get list of UTXOs that used as collateral inputs for transactions with plutus script inputs

  ```tsx
  await wallet.getCollateral();
  ```
</Card>

Example response:
```tsx
[
  {
    "input": {
      "outputIndex": 1,
      "txHash": "ff8d1e97c60989b4f...02ee937595ad741ff597af1"
    },
    "output": {
      "address": "addr_test1qzm...z0fr8c3grjmysm5e6yx",
      "amount": [ { "unit": "lovelace", "quantity": "5000000" } ]
    }
  }
]
```


## Get Network ID

This API retrieves the network ID of the currently connected account. The network ID indicates the blockchain network the wallet is connected to. For example:

- 0: Testnet
- 1: Mainnet

Other network IDs may be returned by wallets, but these are not governed by CIP-30. The network ID remains consistent unless the connected account changes.

Applications can use this information to ensure compatibility with the connected network.

<Card>
  #### Get Network ID [!toc]

  ```tsx
  await wallet.getNetworkId();

          "quantity": "1"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
]
```


## Sign Data

This endpoint utilizes the CIP-8 - Message Signing to sign arbitrary data, to verify the data was signed by the owner of the private key.

`signData` takes two arguments, the first one is the payload to sign and the second one is the address (optional).

By default, we get the first wallet's address with `wallet.getRewardAddresses()`, alternativelly you can specify the address to use.

<Card>
  #### Sign Data [!toc]

  Define a payload and sign it with wallet.

  `Payload: mesh`

  ```tsx
  const signature =  await wallet.signData(mesh);
  ```
</Card>

Example response:
```tsx
{
  "signature": "845846a2012...f9119a18e8977d436385cecb08",
  "key": "a4010103272006215...b81a7f6ed4fa29cc7b33186c"
}
```

Continue reading this guide to learn how to verify the signature.


## Sign Transaction

Requests user to sign the provided transaction (`tx`). The wallet should ask the user for permission, and if given, try to sign the supplied body and return a signed transaction. `partialSign` should be `true` if the transaction provided requires multiple signatures.

<Card>
  #### Sign Transaction [!toc]

  Create a transaction and sign it

  ```tsx
  const signedTx = await wallet.signTx(tx, partialSign?);
  ```

  Check out Transaction to learn more on how to use this API.
</Card>


## Submit Transaction

Wallets inherently have the ability to submit transactions. This API allows applications to request the wallet to send a transaction. If the wallet accepts the transaction and successfully sends it, it will return the transaction ID, enabling the application to track its status. In case of errors during submission, the wallet will provide error messages or failure details.

This functionality is useful for applications that need to interact with the blockchain by submitting signed transactions through the user's wallet.

<Card>
  #### Submit Transaction [!toc]

  Submit a signed transaction with wallet

  ```tsx
  const txHash = await wallet.submitTx(signedTx);
  ```
