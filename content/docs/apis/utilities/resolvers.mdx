## Resolve Transaction Hash

Provide a `cborTx`, `resolveTxHash` will return the transaction hash. This hash is useful for creating chain transactions.

<Card>

  const tx = new Transaction({ initiator: wallet });
  tx.sendLovelace('addr_test1vpvx0sacufuypa2k4sngk7q40zc5c4npl337uusdh64kv0c7e4cxr', '1500000');

  const unsignedTx = await tx.build();
  const hash1 = resolveTxHash(unsignedTx);

  const signedTx = await wallet.signTx(unsignedTx, false);
  const hash2 = resolveTxHash(signedTx);

  const txHash = await wallet.submitTx(signedTx);

  ```
</Card>


## Resolve Data Hash

Converts datum into hash. Getting the hash is useful when you need to query for the UTXO that contain the assets you need for your transaction's input.

Explore <Link href="/apis/transaction">Transaction</Link> to learn more about designing Datum, and learn how to query for UTXOs containing the datum hash.

```

You can also provide date in `milliseconds` to get epoch in the past or the future. For example, get the epoch 1 year from now:

```tsx
import { resolveEpochNo } from '@meshsdk/core';
let oneYearFromNow = new Date();
oneYearFromNow.setFullYear(oneYearFromNow.getFullYear() + 1);
const epoch = resolveEpochNo('preprod', oneYearFromNow.getTime());
```

```tsx
import { resolveSlotNo } from '@meshsdk/core';
let oneYearFromNow = new Date();
oneYearFromNow.setFullYear(oneYearFromNow.getFullYear() + 1);
const slot = resolveSlotNo('preprod', oneYearFromNow.getTime());
```
