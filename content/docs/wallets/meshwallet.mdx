Whether you are building a minting script, or an application that requires multi-signature, `MeshWallet` is all you need to get started.

## Initialize Wallet

This API enables applications to load and initialize a wallet connection. It provides access to the wallet's capabilities, such as signing transactions, submitting transactions, and querying blockchain data.

The wallet connection is established securely, ensuring that sensitive operations are handled by the wallet and not exposed to the application directly. This is crucial for maintaining security and user trust.

Applications can use this functionality to integrate wallet features seamlessly, enabling blockchain interactions without requiring users to manage private keys manually.

You can initialize Mesh Wallet with:

- Mnemonic Phrases
- Private Keys
- Cardano CLI Generated Keys
- Address (Read Only Wallet)

First, we initialize a Provider, which we will assign provider to the `fetcher` and `submitter`.

<Tabs items={["Maestro", "Blockfrost", "Koios", "UTxORPC"]}>
  <Tab value="Maestro">
    ```tsx
    import { MaestroProvider } from '@meshsdk/core';

    const provider = new MaestroProvider({
      network: 'Preprod',
      apiKey: '<Your-API-Key>', // Get yours by visiting https://docs.gomaestro.org/.
      turboSubmit: false
    });
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="Blockfrost">
    ```tsx
    import { BlockfrostProvider } from '@meshsdk/core';

    const provider = new BlockfrostProvider('<BLOCKFROST_API_KEY>');
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="Koios">
    ```tsx
    import { KoiosProvider } from '@meshsdk/core';

    const provider = new KoiosProvider('<api|preview|preprod|guild>', '<token>');
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="UTxORPC">
    ```tsx
    import { U5CProvider } from "@meshsdk/core";

    const provider = new U5CProvider({
      url: "http://localhost:5005U5c",
      headers: {
        "dmtr-api-key": "<api-key>",
      },
    });
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>


### Menmonice Phrases

We can load wallet with menmonice phrases:

```tsx
import { MeshWallet } from '@meshsdk/core';

const wallet = new MeshWallet({
  networkId: 0, // 0: testnet, 1: mainnet
  fetcher: provider,
  submitter: provider,
  key: {
    type: 'mnemonic',
    words: ["solution","solution","solution","solution","solution","solution","solution","solution","solution","solution","solution","solution","solution","solution","solution","solution","solution","solution","solution","solution","solution","solution","solution","solution"],
  },
});
```

With the `wallet` loaded, you can sign transactions, we will see how to do this in the next section, for now lets get the wallet's address:

```tsx
const address = wallet.getChangeAddress();
```


### Private Keys

We can load wallet with private keys:

```tsx
import { MeshWallet } from '@meshsdk/core';

const wallet = new MeshWallet({
  networkId: 0, // 0: testnet, 1: mainnet
  fetcher: provider,
  submitter: provider,
  key: {
    type: 'root',
    bech32: 'xprv1cqa46gk29plgkg98upclnjv5t425fcpl4rgf9mq2txdxuga7jfq5shk7np6l55nj00sl3m4syzna3uwgrwppdm0azgy9d8zahyf32s62klfyhe0ayyxkc7x92nv4s77fa0v25tufk9tnv7x6dgexe9kdz5gpeqgu',
  },
});
```


### Cardano CLI generated skeys

We can load wallet with CLI generated keys by providing the `skey` generated by Cardano CLI. There are two files generated by Cardano CLI, by default it is named `signing.skey` and `stake.skey`. Opening the `signing.skey` file it should contains:

```tsx
{
  "type": "PaymentSigningKeyShelley_ed25519",
  "description": "Payment Signing Key",
  "cborHex": "5820aaca553a7b95b38b5d9b82a5daa7a27ac8e34f3cf27152a978f4576520dd6503"
}
```

We can get the `cborHex` from the `signing.skey` file, and load wallet with Cardano CLI generated skeys. Stake key is optional, but without it, you cannot sign staking transactions.

```tsx
import { MeshWallet } from '@meshsdk/core';

const wallet = new MeshWallet({
  networkId: 0, // 0: testnet, 1: mainnet
  fetcher: provider,
  submitter: provider,
  key: {
    type: 'cli',
    payment: '5820aaca553a7b95b38b5d9b82a5daa7a27ac8e34f3cf27152a978f4576520dd6503',
    stake: '582097c458f19a3111c3b965220b1bef7d548fd75bc140a7f0a4f080e03cce604f0e',
  },
});
```


### Address

We can load wallet with address, this is useful for read-only wallets. A read-only wallet can only query the blockchain, it cannot sign transactions. This is useful for monitoring wallets. We can load wallet with the `address` type:

```tsx
import { MeshWallet } from '@meshsdk/core';

const wallet = new MeshWallet({
  networkId: 0, // 0: testnet, 1: mainnet
  fetcher: provider,
  key: {
    type: 'address',
    address: 'addr_test1qpvx0sacufuypa2k4sngk7q40zc5c4npl337uusdh64kv0uafhxhu32dys6pvn6wlw8dav6cmp4pmtv7cc3yel9uu0nq93swx9',
  },
});
```


### Initialize Wallet

After creating the wallet, we need to initialize it. This will initialize the cryptography library.

```tsx
await wallet.init()
```

With the `wallet` loaded, you can sign transactions, we will see how to do this in the next section, for now lets get the wallet's address:

```tsx
const address = wallet.getChangeAddress();
```


## Generate Wallet

You can generate deterministic keys based on the `Bitcoin BIP39`. These mnemonic phrases are essential for recovering your wallet and ensuring secure access to your funds.

```tsx
const mnemonic = MeshWallet.brew();
```

Once you have your mnemonic phrase, you can use it to generate deterministic keys. These keys include a series of private and public keys, which are crucial for managing your cryptocurrencies securely.

Alternatively, you can generate private keys directly by passing `true` to the `brew` function. This approach is useful for scenarios where you need immediate access to private keys without mnemonic phrases.

```tsx
const privatekey = MeshWallet.brew(true);
```


## Get Balance
