The marketplace smart contract allows users to buy and sell NFTs. A seller list an NFT for sales by specifying a certain price, and anyone can buy it by paying the demanded price.

There are 4 actions (or endpoints) available to interact with this smart contract:

- list asset
- buy asset
- updating listing
- cancel listing

### Install package [!toc]

First you can to install the `@meshsdk/contracts` package:

```tsx
npm install @meshsdk/contract
```

### Initialize the Marketplace [!toc]

Utilizing the Marketplace contract requires a blockchain provider and a connected browser wallet. Here is an example how we can initialize the Marketplace.

```tsx
import { MeshMarketplaceContract } from "@meshsdk/contract";
import { MeshTxBuilder } from "@meshsdk/core";

const provider = new BlockfrostProvider('<Your-API-Key>');

const meshTxBuilder = new MeshTxBuilder({
  fetcher: provider,
  submitter: provider,
});

const contract = new MeshMarketplaceContract(
  {
    mesh: meshTxBuilder,
    fetcher: provider,
    wallet: wallet,
    networkId: 0,
  },
  'addr_test1vpvx0sacufuypa2k4sngk7q40zc5c4npl337uusdh64kv0c7e4cxr',
  200, // 2% fee
);
```

To initialize the Marketplace, we import the `MeshMarketplaceContract`. The first JSON object is the `inputs` for the `MeshTxInitiatorInput`, this requires a `MeshTxBuilder`, a `Provider`, a `Wallet`, and define the network ID.

Second and third parameters are the `ownerAddress` and `feePercentageBasisPoint`. The `ownerAddress` is the address of the marketplace owner which will receive the marketplace fee. The `feePercentageBasisPoint` is the percentage of the sale price that the marketplace `owner` will take. The fee numerator is in the order of hundreds, for example `200` implies a fee of `2%`.

Both on-chain and off-chain codes are open-source and available on <Link href="https://github.com/MeshJS/mesh/tree/main/packages/mesh-contract/src/marketplace">Mesh Github Repository</Link>.


## List Asset

List an asset on the marketplace. This will allow other users to buy the asset. The seller will receive the listing price in ADA. The seller can cancel the listing at any time. The seller can also update the listing price at any time.

`listAsset()` list an asset for sale. The function accepts the following parameters:

- asset (string) - the asset's unit to be listed
- price (number) - the listing price in Lovelace
