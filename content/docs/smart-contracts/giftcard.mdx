Giftcard contract allows users to create a transactions to lock assets into the smart contract, which can be redeemed by any user.

Creating a giftcard will mint a token and send the assets to the contract. While redeeming will burn the token and send the assets to the redeemer.

There are 2 actions (or endpoints) available to interact with this smart contract:

- create giftcard
- redeem giftcard

### Install package [!toc]

First you can to install the `@meshsdk/contracts` package:

```tsx
npm install @meshsdk/contract
```

### Initialize the contract [!toc]

To initialize the contract, we need to initialize a provider, `MeshTxBuilder` and `MeshGiftCardContract`.

```tsx
import { MeshGiftCardContract } from "@meshsdk/contract";
import { MeshTxBuilder } from "@meshsdk/core";

const provider = new BlockfrostProvider('<Your-API-Key>');

const meshTxBuilder = new MeshTxBuilder({
  fetcher: provider,
  submitter: provider,
});

const contract = new MeshGiftCardContract({
  mesh: meshTxBuilder,
  fetcher: provider,
  wallet: wallet,
  networkId: 0,
});
```

Both on-chain and off-chain codes are open-source and available on <Link href="https://github.com/MeshJS/mesh/tree/main/packages/mesh-contract/src/giftcard">Mesh Github Repository</Link>.


## Create Giftcard

`createGiftCard()` create a gift card. The function accepts the following parameters:

- tokenName (string) - name of the token
- giftValue (Asset[]) - a list of assets

The function returns a transaction hash if the gift card is successfully created.

The function returns a transaction hex if giftcard has been created successfully.

  ### Create Giftcard [!toc]

  Create a gift card with a given amount of lovelace

  **Gitfcard amount** `10000000`

  **Giftcard name** `Mesh_Gift_Card`

  ```tsx
  const giftValue: Asset[] = [
    {
      unit: "lovelace",
      quantity: '10000000',
    },
  ];

  const tx = await contract.createGiftCard('Mesh_Gift_Card', giftValue);
  const signedTx = await wallet.signTx(tx);
  const txHash = await wallet.submitTx(signedTx);
  ```
</Card>


## Redeem Giftcard

`redeemGiftCard()` redeem a gift card. The function accepts the following parameters:

- giftCardUtxo (UTxO) - unspent transaction output in the script

The function returns a transaction hash if the gift card is successfully redeemed. It will burn the gift card and transfer the value to the wallet signing this transaction.

The function returns a transaction hex if the gift card has been redeemed successfully.

We have provided a very handle function, `getUtxoByTxHash`, which will return the UTxO object for a given transaction hash. You can always create another function that searches by token name.

  ### Redeem Giftcard [!toc]

  Redeem a gift card given the gift card UTxO

  **Tx hash** `Tx hash`

  ```tsx
  const utxo = await contract.getUtxoByTxHash('');

  const tx = await contract.redeemGiftCard(utxo);
  const signedTx = await wallet.signTx(tx);
  const txHash = await wallet.submitTx(signedTx);
  ```
